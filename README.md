# Automated Testing in Flask
This repository contains the code for a simple web application built using Flask.

It is the whole code for a technical article written for Semaphore CI that aims to:
- Describe what automated testing means and why it's important.
- Describe what are unit and integration tests and how they differ from each other.
- Show how you can use automated testing in your Flask applications.
- Provide a CI testing pipeline by using [Semaphore CI](https://semaphoreci.com/).
